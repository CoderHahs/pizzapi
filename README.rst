Disclaimer

I barely coded anything, and I just wanted to play around, cuz I thought this was cool.
I made a really easy and simple bot that would ask for the information, just to make it easier for me and maybe others to order pizza.

Setup
-----

1. install python3
2. download this repository
3. install the requirements of the repository `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. start a python3 interpreter inside of the folder called pizzapy
5. have fun
